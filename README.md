## Problem 1: Linear Regression 

You are hired by a company named Gem Stones Co Ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of approximately 27,000 pieces of cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive synthesized diamond alternative with similar qualities of a diamond). 

Your objective is to accurately predict prices of the zircon pieces. Since the company profits at a different rate at different price levels, for revenue management, it is important that prices are predicted as accurately as possible. At the same time, it is important to understand which of the predictors are more important in determining the price.


## PROBLEM 2: LOGISTIC REGRESSION 

You are hired by a tour and travel agency which deals in selling holiday packages. You are provided details of 872 employees of a company. Among these employees, some opted for the package and some didn't. You have to help the company in predicting whether an employee will opt for the package or not on the basis of the information given in the data set. Also, find out the important factors on the basis of which the company will focus on particular employees to sell their packages.
